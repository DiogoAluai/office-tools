# Setup
PRINTER_IP env is used. One way to have it setup is by adding `export PRINTER_IP="<printer ip>"` to the `.bashrc` file.

# TODO
- Improve on '\r' addition, to not rely on 'l' character
- Add script that finds printer ip
- Create page size aware architectural design
- Find a way to print in landscape mode
